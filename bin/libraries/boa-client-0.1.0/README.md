# About Boa Client API

The Boa Client API provides programmatic access to the Boa language and infrastructure.

# Compiling

All compile- and run- time dependences are included in the repository.  To compile the
API, simply run 'ant' from the repositories root directory.

There are a few other ant targets available:

- compile - just compiles the source code (but does not generate a .jar)
- clean - removes any generated/compiled files
- gen-docs - generates the JavaDoc API documentation into docs/api/
