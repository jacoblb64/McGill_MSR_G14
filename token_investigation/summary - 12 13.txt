relationships explored against score:
	frequency
		high frequency words generally score higher
	dictionary word, or close neighbour
		no apparent relationship
	more definitions as per wordnet
		NAR
	part of speech tagging
		NAR
	POS tagging in identified words, and neighbours
		NAR
	short list of words: ["stuff", "thing", "things"]
		score higher
	longer list of "vague" words and neighbours
		score higher
	swear words and neighbours
		score higher

subsets explored:
	cutoff for tokens with very low frequency
		>1
		>10
		>100
		>1000
		knee: 3 or so?
	1000 arbitrary

inverse idea, looking at high scoring words for trends:
	freq > 100, score > 0.8

ideas explored:
	POS
	Dictionary word
	synonyms via wordnet
	vague words
	swear words

new ideas:
	spell check on commit message
	tag vagueness and then create classifier (commit level)
		look at spammiest messages

next steps:
	Select sample size and tag "vague" or not
	Select top X spammiest messages
		look for pattern
