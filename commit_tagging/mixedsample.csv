Debouncers ensure that only the last signal in a sequence fires an action, and are commonly used to help throttle computationally-expensive reactions to quickly-repeated user input sequences (e.g. only refreshing a view when a user is done scrolling a page or done typing in a text input).This implementation, like goog.async.Throttle, also adds support for pausing, resuming, and stopping (i.e. canceling current sequences), which adds considerable complexity in the many edge-cases that need to be handled. Because it is so easy to implement incorrectly (source: I did so multiple times before getting it right), it makes sense for it to be provided as a well-tested, reliable part of the goog.async library.nnIn addition, for simpler cases of debouncing, this CL also adds unpausable debounce/throttle decorators to the goog.functions namespace. Because of a newly circular dependency from the use of goog.Timer in goog.functions (javascript/closure/promise/promise.js > javascript/closure/async/run.js > javascript/closure/async/nexttick.js > javascript/closure/functions/functions.js > javascript/closure/timer/timer.js > javascript/closure/promise/promise.js), I had to make a trivial modification to eliminate an unusued dependency in promise.js and inline the identity function in nexttick.js to break its dependency on the goog.functions namespace.n-------------nCreated by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-javanMOE_MIGRATED_REVID=100713402n","False","Feature Addition","t",2,4,7,2.17942611124889,511,2,482.428571428571,162,12.5974255952381,1589,153,1.0773564461945,148,0,"plovr",162,0.5,"ham"
