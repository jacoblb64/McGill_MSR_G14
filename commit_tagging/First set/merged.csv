It considered the failure to create thenauto-merge tree as if the tree creation succeeded with conflicts. Innfact, the auto merge tree was empty and Gerrit considered all pathsnas unmerged.  This caused several issues:n- the file list was too large for a project with large number of filesn- Gerrit would send too many false notification emails to those watchingn  changes under certain pathsn- both client and server needed a lot of resources in order to handlen  such a large list of filesnnWith this change the file list will be empty when creation of auto-mergencommit fails.

That extra data will confuse the headernand footer fixup logic when it tries to read to the end of the file.nnThis isn't a very common case to occur, which is why we've nevernseen it before.  Getting a delta that requires a whole object whichnuses less than 20 bytes in pack representation is really hard.nGenerally a delta generator won't make these, because the deltanwould be bigger than simply deflating the whole object.  I onlynmanaged to do this with a hand-crafted pack file where a 1 bytendelta was pointed to a 1 byte whole object.nnNormally we try really hard to avoid truncating, because itsntypically not safe across network filesystems.  But the odds ofnthis occurring are very low.  This truncation is done on a filenwe have open for writing, will append more content onto, and isna temporary file that we won't move into position for others tonsee until we've validated its SHA-1 is sane.
